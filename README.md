# CA-js2 - Dogfriend

## Description

This project is the second course assignment of the second year for Front End Development students at Noroff, covering JavaScript 2. I have used a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/bd52QtXF/js2) to manage my tasks during the work on the assignment.

Dogfriend is a social media application where dog owners can create a profile for their dogs and connect with other dog owners.

The website is made for mobile first, but is responsive across devices.

## Pages

There are three pages to the application.

### Login page

Here users can log in to an existing account, or register a new user.

### Feed

The feed allows users to create, edit and delete posts, and also to see posts from other users.
There is a filter function to see posts with or without images, and a search bar.

### Profile page

The profile page loads the logged in users name, avatar and bio, and also show their own posts.
